# E-Pass Application using FLASK

## Prathyush Taneti

In this Project one will be able to make a request for the Travelling Pass from one state to another. This Project is made using Flask. It uses a Third Party Library called Twilio which is known for integrating sms apps and Whatsapp with the Software Applications whenever a request is made then it redirects to a new page and displays the request details with the status of the request and simultaneously a Whatsapp message will be sent to the user about the same.

The status of the request is determined by taking the consideration of total Population and the Active cases of Covid19.
